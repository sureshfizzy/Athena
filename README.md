## Deployment

<b>Only local deployment is working for now!</b>

### Easiest Way
You can deploy BotsApp in minimal time without any prior knowledge using this method.

1. Clone/Fork and download the codes to your PC or server
2. Open the folder in your terminal and run the following commands -
```bash 
npm install
```
3. Create the `config.env` file in the root directory and add the following fields -
```bash
BING_COOKIE="<Your bing cookie>"
```
3. Run ```npm start``` to start the app.
4. Scan the QR code shown using your WhatsApp account (3 dots on top right corner -> Linked devices -> LINK A DEVICE). Click on the 'Continue'      button once done.
4. Once the bot is linked to your account, you will come across a form which can be used to manage settings/permissions of BotsApp. If required,    change the form fields. Then, click on the submit button.
5. Try using the '.alive' command in any of your chats to verify whether    your bot has been deployed succesfully.

Voila! You have deployed your bot in 5 easy steps. Once the bot has started successfully, you'll see a integration message on your whatsapp account.
